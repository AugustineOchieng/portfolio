      <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio</h1>
      <p>I don't know where this road leads which is why I took it: not to ask where  it goes but to folllow it and so is being in love with what one does not a choice one makes once.
      But a choice we make multiple times.This is my personal philosophy in the evolutionary world of IT for adaptbilty is a skill one must have and so is thicker skin for computers never reveal their secrets easily.
      I am passionate about what I do and well equipped with industry relevant information. I am candid and with this ability I am able to take up callenges I meet with an open-mind and vibrance.</p>
